                <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
                <p>Demographics: Age, Income, Education, Geographic Location <br>Age is 19 years old. Income is less than $1000 per year. Education is their high school diploma, and they are working on getting their bachelor's degree. Geographic location is Springville, Illinois.</p>
                <p>How did the site meet their needs? <br>It provided them with a categories for things they would be interested in, and specifics per category. This allows them to read for certain genre or specific shows or stories without having to constantly search through lists of unrelated stuff.</p>
                <p>How was content organized? <br>The content was organized by category, names of things that fit in that category, and then by most recently updated story.</p>
                <p>What did the site do to create good user experience? It makes it easy to find stories in the categories readers are interested in. The stories with the most recent updates are put at the top of the list, and it provides a lot of information so readers can choose whether or not they would like to read the story before having to look to closely. They followed convention with the hyperlinks, which makes it easy to know it's a hyperlink.</p>
                <p>Did the site work well on mobile? If yes, how? <br>The site worked well on mobile by having no need for horizontal scrolling, and the text was all appropriately sized. It didn't take forever to get to the bottom of the page, but the page was also long enough that users didn't have to be switching pages all the time.</p>

				<h2>Persona</h2>
				<p>Fictitious Name: Jessica Ross</p>
				<figure>
					<img alt="The face of my persona page, alias: Jessica" src="/images/persona-girl.jpg">
				</figure>
                <p>Job title/ Major Responsibilities: <br>Full-time college student in the first semester. Their responsibilities are to keep up on their homework and work to get their degree eventually. They also need to keep control of their finances.</p>
                <p>Demographics: <br>19 Years old, Income is less than $1000 per year. No kids, and currently no job, since they are 'getting their feet wet' before taking on a part time job. They have enough money in their savings to get them through for a little bit before working.</p>
                <p>Goals and Tasks: <br>Jessica wants to read, practice her writing abilities, and still keep up with her favorite shows. She wants feedback on her writing while not having to go into a writing center all the time. She also wants to read without having to pay for books and going to the library all the time, since her textbooks were already expensive enough!</p>
                <p>Environment: <br>Jessica is living in a dorm with 5 other girls. They aren't super close, and she hasn't made many friends on campus yet, so she spends a lot of time online.</p>
                <p>Quote: <br>"I just need to share this idea I had about my favorite show with other people who like the same show without it being totally illegal."</p>

            <h2>Site Contrasting: FanFiction vs Pinterest</h2>
                <p>Did they or did they not know who their target audience was? <br>Pinterest knew who their audience was. The biggest problem was no one could tell, because their site wasn't reachable on mobile browsing. They expect their audience to be able to use the app to get on it, and make it part of their normal applications they use frequently, instead of a check every once in a while through a browser.</p>
                <p>Did they or did they not meet the needs of their audience? <br>Pinterest did meet the needs of their audience. I tried to get onto their site multiple times throughout the day through mobile browsing, and it kept saying "There was a problem with the page, so it was reloaded." I couldn't even log on to get on my Pinterest account, but there was a link to get the app before any of the page problems popped up.</p>
                <p>Did they or did they not organize content to facilitate it being found? <br> If I could have gotten on site, I could tell you. Through mobile browsing, FanFiction was better organized, and Pinterest was not. However, using the app, Pinterest is better and FanFiction isn't as good.</p>
                <p>Did the site facilitate visitors in a mobile environment? <br>The site did not facilitate visitors in a mobile environment. It has an app that works splendidly, but accessing it from a moblile browser did not work. FanFiction is really well developed for mobile, with everything planned for the smaller screens. There isn't any horizontal scrolling that had to take place, and the page wasn't forever long vertical wise. It was long enough to not have to be changing pages all the time, but short enough to keep it interesting.</p>
                <p>Why are you doing this? <br>I am doing this to satisfy the requirement. It also provides an easy place to rant about the lack of a chance to check Pinterest without using the space of an app.</p>
