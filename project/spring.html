        <p><em>This is a summary of the clothing that sister missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints should expect to wear on their mission during the Spring season.</em></p>
        <h2>Shoes</h2>

        <p>Shoes in Spring should be smart, allowing for both the end of winter and the beginning of summer. It's fine to switch between boots and shoes as the season progresses, as long as you are prepared for the spring rains that often last into summer.</p>
        <h2>Skirts/Dresses</h2>
        <p>Skirts and dresses shouldn't be overly long to avoid getting the hems soaked in the winter snow or the spring rains. Keep skirt lengths appropriate for representatives of Jesus Christ, as that is the reason missionaries are serving. </p>
        <h2>Shirts/Jackets</h2>
        <p>Shirts and Jackets also depend on what part of the season is occurring. If it's earlier in the season, warmer is better, with long sleeved shirts and wind/weather proof coats. However, these can be switched for warmer weather to shorter sleeved and lighter jackets. </p>
        <h2>Accessories</h2>
        <p>A sturdy umbrella is suggested for the Toronto spring rains. These rains also occur occasionally in the summer months.</p>
