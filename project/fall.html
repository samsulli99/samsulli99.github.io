        <p><em>This is a summary of the clothing sister missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints should have to wear during the Fall season in Toronto, Canada.</em></p>
        <h2>Shoes</h2>
        <p>Suggested footwear in the Fall season ranges from regular summer footwear like flats and close-toed sandals to boots.</p>
        <h2>Skirts/Dresses</h2>
        <p>Skirts and dresses in early fall should be knee length and loose. As the season progresses, they should get to be mid-calf length but no longer than that. </p>
        <h2>Shirts/Jackets</h2>
        <p>Shirts should be short-sleeved, but can be longer sleeved as needed as the temperature changes. Jackets should be light in color and fabric for comfort, but can be heavier.</p>
        <h2>Accessories</h2>
        <p>Gloves are suggested for the end of the fall season.</p>
