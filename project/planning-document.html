      <h1>Planning Document</h1>
      <p><small>By Samantha Sullivan, 12/5/16</small></p>
      <p><em>This is the Planning Document page of this Site</em></p>
      <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
      <p>The project will be an easy to understand list of items suggested for those girls 19 or older who are going on a LDS mission to Toronto, Canada. It will give them appropriate clothing for the time of year in different pages, and what type of clothing is approved for lady missionaries to wear. </p>
      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>The audience is women who are 19 or a little older and going on a mission to Toronto, Canada. They want to start getting their clothes planned out so they can get the clothing they will need purchased. They also don’t want to have to go to multiple websites for their information, so the information needs to be comprehensive and answer their questions. They also want suggestions on good, quality companies that can provide the type of clothing they will need. </p>
